WikipediaNameLookerUpper is a Python script that checks if a list of names have corresponding Wikipedia pages. It takes a text file containing a list of names as input and uses the Wikipedia API to search for the existence of a page for each name. The script then generates two output files:

1. ~links.txt~: This file contains the results of the search, indicating whether each name has a Wikipedia page or not. If a page is found, the corresponding Wikipedia URL is provided.

2. ~known-names.txt~: This file contains a list of names that have Wikipedia pages along with their respective URLs. If a URL appears multiple times (i.e., if a name appears in different variations), only the first occurrence is kept, and subsequent duplicates are removed.

** Development
I wrote this script (i.e. I made claude 3 write this script) as part of the [[https://www.wikiportraits.org/][WikiPortraits]] initiative.

Here's Claude developing the code:

** Features
- Reads a list of names from a text file
- Searches for the existence of Wikipedia pages for each name using the Wikipedia API
- Generates a file (~links.txt~) with the search results, indicating the presence or absence of a Wikipedia page for each name
- Creates a file (~known-names.txt~) with a list of names that have Wikipedia pages and their corresponding URLs
- Handles duplicate URLs by keeping only the first occurrence and removing subsequent duplicates

** Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ~requests~ library (can be installed via ~pip install requests~)

** Usage
1. Prepare a text file (~names.txt~) containing a list of names, with each name on a separate line.
2. Update the file paths in the script to match your local setup:

   - ~input_file~: Path to the input file containing the list of names
   - ~output_file~: Path where the ~links.txt~ file will be generated
   - ~known_names_file~: Path where the ~known-names.txt~ file will be generated

3. Run the script using Python:
#+begin_example
   python check-wikipedia.py
#+end_example

4. The script will process the names, perform the Wikipedia search, and generate the output files.
5. Check the ~links.txt~ file for the search results and the ~known-names.txt~ file for the list of names with Wikipedia pages and their URLs.
